log:
just added the keys and the technical way to win escape game mode
need to add a way to steal items and monsters that steal items
loot corpse, etc.

also cool idea: vampires
game mode changes from escaping to drinking enough blood


working on item functionality, commands, and hasKeyWords to simplify interpreting
map_canvas ideas:
We have a canvas with a black background
The room with the current player is always the center, perhaps with a scroll button to offset
rooms are just brown squares with lines to represent doors
playes appear as dots in the room

mapData is made up of rooms, and each room has an array players

//
Just added the canvas object and test-draw function
just finished making enter use the send button
kind of have rooms working, will eventually define them in a seperate file
rooms can currently overlap
next step will probably be to add room randomization
then graphics
then a map
and somewhere it should say what players are in the room
